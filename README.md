# C Compiler

## Project Overview

Welcome to the C_Compiler project! This is a C++-based implementation of a C compiler, designed to take C code and convert it into machine-readable instructions. The project aims to provide a clear, efficient, and educational tool for compiling C code. Whether you're a student learning how compilers work or a developer interested in working with low-level code, this project can serve as a great starting point.

## Project Structure

To make the development process clear and maintainable, the project is organized into three main directories:

- **compiler**: This is the heart of the project. It contains all the source code for the compiler itself, including components like lexical analysis, parsing, optimization, and code generation. Here, youâ€™ll find the logic that takes raw C code and processes it into executable code.

- **tests**: As with any good project, testing is crucial. The `tests` directory is where we store all the test cases and test structure for verifying the compiler's functionality. By running these tests, you can ensure that every part of the compiler is working correctly, and that it's capable of handling a wide variety of C programs.

- **documentation**: To help both users and developers get the most out of this project, the `documentation` folder contains comprehensive guides. The user documentation will explain how to set up and use the compiler, while the developer documentation goes into more technical detail about how the project works, its architecture, and how to contribute or extend it.

This structure allows for a clean separation between the core functionality, testing, and documentation, which makes it easier to navigate and maintain the project over time. Whether you're interested in the underlying compiler logic, looking to test the functionality, or reading through the documentation, everything is organized to ensure smooth development and usage.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, or dive into the docs for a deeper understanding of how this compiler is built and works!
